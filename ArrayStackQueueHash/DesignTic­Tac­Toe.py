#   Design Tic Tac Toe   设计井字棋游戏



Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

You may assume the following rules:

A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
Example:
Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | | // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | | // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | | // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| | // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| | // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| | // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| | // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
Follow up:
Could you do better than O(n2) per move() operation?

Hint:

Could you trade extra space such that move() operation can be done in O(1)?
You need two arrays: int rows[n], int cols[n], plus two variables: diagonal, anti_diagonal.

'''
Follow up中让我们用更高效的方法，那么根据提示中的，我们建立一个大小为n的一维数组rows和cols
，还有变量对角线diag和逆对角线rev_diag，这种方法的思路是，如果玩家1在第一行某一列放了一个子，那么rows[0]自增1
，如果玩家2在第一行某一列放了一个子，则rows[0]自减1，那么只有当rows[0]等于n或者-n的时候，表示第一行的子都是一个玩家放的，
则游戏结束返回该玩家即可，其他各行各列，对角线和逆对角线都是这种思路


'''



Record the number of moves for each rows, columns, and two diagonals.
For each move, we -1 for each player 1's move and +1 for player 2's move.
Then we just need to check whether any of the recored numbers equal to n or -n.

class TicTacToe(object):

    def __init__(self, n):
        self.row, self.col, self.diag, self.anti_diag, self.n = [0] * n, [0] * n, 0, 0, n
        
    def move(self, row, col, player):
        offset = player * 2 - 3
        self.row[row] += offset
        self.col[col] += offset
        if row == col:
            self.diag += offset
        if row + col == self.n - 1:
            self.anti_diag += offset
        if self.n in [self.row[row], self.col[col], self.diag, self.anti_diag]:
            return 2
        if -self.n in [self.row[row], self.col[col], self.diag, self.anti_diag]:
            return 1
        return 0
