#  115. Distinct Subsequences
'

'''

 Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

Here is an example:
S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"

Return 3.

        DP[i+1][j+1] means that S[0..j] contains T[0..i] that many times 
        
        as distinct subsequences. Therefor the result will be mem[T.length()][S.length()].
        
         T[i-1] != S[j-1],              dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]  # rabb   rab 
          T[i-1] == S[j-1],        dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + d[i-1][j-1]
         
    From here we can easily fill the whole grid: for each (x, y), we check if S[x] == T[y] we add the previous item and the previous item in the previous row, otherwise we copy the previous item in the same row. The reason is simple:

if the current character in S doesnâ€™t equal to current character T, then we have the same number of distinct subsequences as we had without the new character.
if the current character in S equal to the current character T, then the distinct number of subsequences: the number we had before plus the distinct number of subsequences we had with less longer T and less longer S.
