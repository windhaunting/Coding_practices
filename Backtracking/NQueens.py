# leetcode 51. N-Queens I, 52. N-Queens II



'''
 N-Queens I,

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an nÃ—n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.


Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' 
both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

For example,
There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:

output:

[
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]

        O(n^n) is an upper bound on solving n-queens using backtracking.
        I'm assuming that solving this by assigning a queen column-wise.   
        However, consider this - when you assign a location of the queen in the first column, you have n options, after that, you only have n-1 options as         you can't the queen in the same row as the first queen, then n-2 and so on. Thus, the worst-case complexity is still upper bounded by O(n!).

Follow up for N-Queens problem.

Now, instead outputting board configurations, return the total number of distinct solutions.
